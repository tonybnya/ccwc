NAME
    ccwc - word, line, character, and byte count.

DESCRIPTION
    The ccwc utility displays the number of words, lines, characters,
    and bytes contained in each input file. A line is defined as
    a string of characters delimited by a (newline) character.

    A word is defined as a string of characters delimited by whitespace
    characters. If more than one input file is specified, a line of
    cumulative counts for all the files is displayed on a separate
    line after the output for the last file.

USAGE:
    The following options are available:

    ./ccwc.py test.txt              default action
    ./ccwc.py -c test.txt           number of bytes
    ./ccwc.py -l test.txt           number of lines
    ./ccwc.py -m test.txt           number of characters
    ./ccwc.py -w test.txt           number of words
    cat test.txt | ./ccwc.py -l     read from standard input

    When an option is specified, ccwc only reports the information
    requested by that option. The order of output always takes The
    form of line, word, byte, and filename. The default action is
    equivalent to specifying the -c, -l, and -w options.
